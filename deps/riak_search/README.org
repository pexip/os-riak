The =riak_search= OTP application provides
[[Riak][https://github.com/basho/riak]] with the capability to act as a /text
search engine/ similar to Apache's Lucene.  Previously Riak Search was
a release in it's own right.  Since then Basho has decided it would be
easier for our users if Search was simply a set of functionality that
can be enabled via a config option.  For that reason, if you want to
use Search you'll have to build a Riak release and enable it.

* Enabling Search

In order to enable the =riak_search= app in your Riak cluster you have
to modify the =etc/app.config= file.  Search for the text
=riak_search= and then change ={enabled, false}= to ={enabled, true}=.
The Search portion of your =app.config= will look something like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC
{riak_search, [
               {enabled, true},
              ]},
#+END_SRC
