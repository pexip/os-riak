Riak Search Beta 2 Release Notes
--------------------------------

This is a beta-quality release of Riak Search. This release almost
certainly contains bugs and is being provided for evaluation purposes
only.

New features:

* Raptor internalized -- The primary backedn for Riak Search, Raptor,
  has been added to the Riak embedded node, such that it is no longer
  necessary to run Raptor separately.  Raptor will now start and stop
  with the Riak node using it. (bugs 152 & 166)

* Delete implemented -- Deleting documents from an index is now
  supported, through the standard Solr method of POSTing a document to
  the index, with a body containging a
  <delete><id>DOCUMENT_ID</id></delete> directive.  Query-deletion
  (<delete><query>QUERY</query></delete>) is also supported. (bug 164)

* Phrase search -- Quoted phrase searching is now supported. (bug 98)

* Facets -- the Solr interface now supports searching and indexing on
  facets. (bugs 154, 155, 156)

Other bugfixes:

* support for "-field:X" and "+field:X" as well as other Lucene
  parsing improvements (bugs 158, 159)

* no more errors for index names specified in query strings (bug 160)

Known Issues:

* The alternate delete syntax, which includes the index name
  (<delete><id>INDEX_NAME:DOCUMENT_ID</id></delete>) is not supported
  at this time. (bug 204)

* Fuzzy queries aren't implemented (bug 90)

* Ranking and scoring aren't implemented (bug 99)

* riak_solr doesn't support dynamic or computed document fields (bug 161)
