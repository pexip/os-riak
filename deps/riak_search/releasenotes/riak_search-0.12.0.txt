Riak Search 0.12.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------

Riak Search 0.12.0 introduces many important usability improvements,
including packaged installs for Ubuntu, better documentation
(doc/using_search.org), and a command line interface (search-cmd) for
simple indexing and testing. 

A greater subset of Lucene syntax is now supported, including fuzzy
searches. The Solr interface now supports output in both XML and JSON,
and supports Solr arguments for sorting and default operations and
fields. Additionally, the schema has been updated to provide more
flexibility, with per-field analyzers and dynamic fields. 

The integration between Riak Search, the Lucene analyzers, and the
backend has been improved, eliminating the need to start any
applications separately from Riak Search. Riak Search now starts up
any required dependencies, monitors them during operation, and cleanly
shuts them down on exit.

Please read the documentation (docs/using_search.org) for new installation 
instructions.
