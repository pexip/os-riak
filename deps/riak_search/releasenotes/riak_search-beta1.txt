Riak Search Beta 1 Release Notes
--------------------------------

This is a beta-quality release of Riak Search. This release almost certainly contains
bugs and is being provided for evaluation purposes only.

This release of Riak includes several completely new components unique to Riak Search.
These components are:

* riak_search -- riak_search manages the distributed
  search index and contains the query planning and execution engine.

* qilr -- It supports the complete Lucene query syntax and builds the query
  representation used by riak_search.

* raptor -- a high performance Riak storage back end specifically tailored to the
  unique access patterns of a full text search engine.

* riak_solr --  allows external applications to query and update Riak Search
  indices using a subset of Solr's API.

New features:

* Distributed search index -- The index exhibits the same behavior as a standard
  Riak Key/Value cluster. This means storage and compute capacity can be expanded
  by adding more nodes to an existing cluster. Riak Search nodes use hinted
  handoff to transparently cope with crashed or unavailable nodes.

* Full text indexing -- This release provides two ways to write data to the
  the search index. An Erlang API is provided via the riak_search_client module.
  External applications can also update the search index over HTTP by using the
  Solr interface.

* Lucene syntax support -- A subset of the full Lucene syntax is supported in
  this release. The support constructs are: single term queries, field queries,
  word proximity queries, single wildcards at the end of query terms, and
  boolean and grouping operators.

* Full text querying -- Two query APIs, Erlang and Solr are provided in this release.

Known Issues:

* riak_solr needs to understand facets (bugs 154, 155, 156)

* Fuzzy queries aren't implemented (bug 90)

* Phrase queries aren't implemented (bug 98)

* Ranking and scoring aren't implemented (bug 99)

* Queries with forms "-field:X" or "+field:X" do not parse correctly (bug 159)

* riak_solr throws an error when writing to an index if the index name is
  specified in the query string (bug 160)

* riak_solr doesn't support dynamic or computed document fields (bug 161)
